# cdm.bash.in: change to directory, creating it first if it does not yet exist.
# If multiple directories are named, all will be created (if necessary), and
# we will change to the last one named on the command line.
#
# HINT: The "change to last directory named" behavior is intended to be
#       analogous to the POSIX cp(1) command, when invoked with more than two
#       file names:
#
#           $ cp FILE... TARGET
#
#       In such a situation, the TARGET argument is expected to be a
#       directory, and the other named files are copied into it.
#
# Since a subprocess cannot change the current working directory of a parent
# process, this script must be "sourced" in your current shell process to have
# the desired effect. To make that ergonomic, create a function such as the
# following in your ~/.bashrc:
#
#     function cdm () {
#         local impl_fpath='path/to/cdm.bash'
#         if test -e "${impl_fpath}"; then :; else
#             printf "cdm: (error): no such file: %s; bailing out\n" "${impl_fpath}" 1>&2
#             return 1
#         fi
#     
#         source "${impl_fpath}" "$@"
#         return $?
#     }
#
#
# The 'cdm.bash' script effectively does this:
#
#     $ mkdir -p path/to/firstdir path/to/seconddir path/to/nthdir
#     $ cd path/to/nthdir
#
# Yes, this is done frequently enough that it merits its own wrapper script.
#
# Note that common usage is expected to be simple, as in:
#
#     $ cdm path/to/somedir
#
# but the behavior of accepting multiple directory arguments on the command
# line is intended to allow (also pretty common) uses such as:
#
#     $ cdm path/to/some-project/{pristine,munge}
#
# which is a common pattern for the author, and after shell expansion results
# in the following two-argument invocation:
#
#     $ cdm path/to/some-project/pristine path/to/some-project/munge
#
#
# CAVEAT: The '-h' (--help) and '-V' (--version) options are supported, but
#         not arbitrary command line opts. In particular, there is neither a
#         '-v' (--verbose) option nor support for the conventional '--'
#         pseudo-option. Hence, this script is unable to create directories
#         named in such a way that they look like command line opts. If you
#         need to do such things, you're probably using 'mkdir' directly,
#         anyway, so these limitations are not expected to be a problem in
#         practice.
#
# TODO:
#
#     * Maybe just do everything inside the 'cdm' shell function? That would
#       avoid souring this separate file.
#
#     * Maybe source 'cdm.bash' once during shell startup (for interactive
#       shells only). The function definition could be provided at that time,
#       which would make it more easily reusable.


# Our --help output and any error messages emitted will identify the program
# as 'cdm', not 'cdm.bash' (even though the latter is strictly speaking more
# correct). From the user's perspective, it is the 'cdm' tool that was
# invoked; producing any other name on the output is just needlessly leaking
# implementation details.

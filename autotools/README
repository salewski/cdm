This is the 'README' file from the subdirectory:

    autotools/

of the 'cdm' project.

This directory exists as the home for any custom m4 macros, if any, need by
the project build, which is based on the GNU Autotools. Even if we do not have
any such macros currently, we want this subdirectory to exist both as a
reminder of where they would go, and also because this location is referenced
from the 'configure.ac' file in the top-level directory of the project. Search
that file for 'AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR'.

Note that the Git version control system does not track empty directories;
directories exist in the repository only as a side effect of Git tracking
files within those directories. Therefore, this 'README' file also serves the
purpose of being able to have an otherwise empty 'autotools/' subdir as part
of the Git repo.

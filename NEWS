*** issue #1: "build: autoconfiscate 'cdm' project"

    https://github.com/salewski/cdm/issues/1

    The 'cdm' project now provides a proper GNU Autotools-style 'configure'
    script, to make it easier for sysadmins and/or end-users to install the
    project. This allows users to type the expect sequence:

    :    $ configure --prefix=/path/to/location
    :
    :    $ make
    :
    :    $ make install

    The "autoconfiscation" also introduced a new command line utility:
    'cdm-generate'. This program emits the Bash definition of the 'cdm()'
    shell function, which is intended to make it easier to add the definition
    to your shell startup files (e.g., '~/.bash_profile' or '~/.bashrc'),
    since the program can be invoked from within your text editor (e.g., emacs
    or vi) to obtain the text (as opposed to having to copy an paste the
    definition from some file which would otherwise need to be located first).

    Here's an example of the output emitted:

    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    :   $ /path/to/bin/cdm-generate
    :   
    :   # Avoid defining the cdm() function, if not running interactively
    :   case $- in
    :       *i*)
    :   
    :   # cdm: like (conditional) 'mkdir -p' followed by 'cd'.
    :   #
    :   # Create DIRECTORY... arguments, if they do not yet exist
    :   # (any needed parent directories will be created, as well);
    :   # then change (cd) to the DIRECTORY argument named last on the command line.
    :   #
    :   # Usage:
    :   #        cdm { -h | --help }
    :   #   OR:  cdm { -V | --version }
    :   #   OR:  cdm DIRECTORY...
    :   #
    :   # @parma DIRECTORY... - (required) One or more directories to create (if
    :   #                       necessary) before cd'ing into the one named last on
    :   #                       the command line.
    :   #
    :   function cdm () {
    :       local impl_fpath="/path/to/share/cdm/bash/cdm.bash"  # location filtered-in at build time
    :       if test -e "${impl_fpath}"; then :; else
    :           printf "cdm: (error): no such file: %s; bailing out\n" "${impl_fpath}" 1>&2
    :           return 1
    :       fi
    :   
    :       source "${impl_fpath}" "$@"
    :       return $?
    :   }
    :            ;;
    :   esac
    #+END_QUOTE

*** issue #2: "cdm: allow multiple directory (sub)trees to be specified on the command line, and 'cd' into the last"

    https://github.com/salewski/cdm/issues/2

    This enhancement allows for common desired usage patterns such as:

    :   $ cdm YYYY/MM/DD/whatever/{pristine,munge}
    :   /path/to/YYYY/MM/DD/whatever/munge
    :   [user is now in the directory 'YYYY/MM/DD/whatever/munge/']

    Notice that the command as typed above uses shell expansion syntax that
    results in the 'cdm' command receiving two command line arguments, exactly
    as if the user had typed:

    :   $ cdm YYYY/MM/DD/whatever/pristine YYYY/MM/DD/whatever/munge

    Prior to this enhancement, achieving the same end result required the
    following three-command sequence:

    :   $ cdm YYYY/MM/DD/whatever/
    :   /path/to/YYYY/MM/DD/whatever/
    :   [user is now in the directory 'YYYY/MM/DD/whatever/']

    :   $ mkdir pristine munge
    :   [two subdirectories have been created]

    :   $ cd munge
    :   [user is now in the directory 'YYYY/MM/DD/whatever/munge/']


* cdm 0.0.1  (circa 2020-10-25)

** Initial version of project.

   The project currently provides Bash-specific shell function, =cdm=, whose
   implementation is split across two file:

       'cdm.bash'
       'cdm_function.bash.in'

   The meat of the implementation is in the 'cdm.bash' file, which needs to be
   "sourced" into a user's shell session to be useful.

   The 'cdm_function.bash.in' file contains an example definition of the 'cdm'
   shell function, which the user is expected to edit an place in a Bash shell
   startup configuration file (=~/.bash_profile=, =~/.bashrc=, or
   similar). The function must be edited to allow it to find the 'cdm.bash'
   file, wherever you happened to put that on your system.

   Once the above two pieces are in place, the user makes use of the 'cdm'
   function like so:

   :   $ cdm path/to/some/new/subdirectory

   That has the same effect as if the user had typed the following two
   commands separately:

   :   $ mkdir -p path/to/some/new/subdirectory
   :
   :   $ cd path/to/some/new/subdirectory

   The reason the functionality needs to be implemented as a shell function is
   that it needs to be able to change the current working directory of the
   user's interactive shell process. Unix sub-processes (such as non-builtin
   command a user invokes from the shell prompt) cannot affect the current
   working directory of their parent process.

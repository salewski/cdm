Building from a Source Tarball
==============================

If you simply want to build the 'cdm' project (as opposed to hacking on the
codebase), the easiest thing to do is obtain a source distribution tarball of
the version of the project you wish to build.

Source tarballs are available from the project's website:

    http://salewski.email/cdm/

specifically on the Downloads Archive page:

    http://salewski.email/cdm/downloads/

[Writing in 2025-03, the source tarballs are also available in the project's
Git repository on the 'gh-pages' branch, in the 'downloads/' directory. We
currently follow this practice because the number of release tarballs is
small, and doing so makes hosting the project's website via GitHub Pages
easy. However, that practice may not continue indefinitely, since it
artificially bloats the size of the Git repo.]

Using a source tarball relieves you of having access to specific versions of
the GNU Autotools, etc.

Note that the curl(1) command line in the following example is using POSIX
shell expansion to request not only the source tarball, but also the various
checksums files that are made available for it. (Curl needs one '-O' option
for each such expansion in order to save the content of the files locally,
hence the '-OOOOOOOOO' option.)

    $ cd /usr/local/src
    .../src$ curl -OOOOOOOOO -R http://salewski.email/cdm/downloads/cdm-0.1.0.tar.gz{,.SHA-{1,256,384,512},.SHA3-{224,256,384,512}}
    .../src$ ls | grep cdm
    cdm-0.1.0.tar.gz
    cdm-0.1.0.tar.gz.SHA-1
    cdm-0.1.0.tar.gz.SHA-256
    cdm-0.1.0.tar.gz.SHA-384
    cdm-0.1.0.tar.gz.SHA-512
    cdm-0.1.0.tar.gz.SHA3-224
    cdm-0.1.0.tar.gz.SHA3-256
    cdm-0.1.0.tar.gz.SHA3-384
    cdm-0.1.0.tar.gz.SHA3-512
    .../src$
    .../src$ $ sha512sum --check cdm-0.1.0.tar.gz.SHA-512
    ./cdm-0.1.0.tar.gz: OK
    .../src$
    .../src$ gzip -dc cdm-0.1.0.gz | tar xf -
    .../src$ cd cdm-0.1.0
    .../src/cdm-0.1.0$ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/whatever
    .../src/cdm-0.1.0$ make
    .../src/cdm-0.1.0$ make check
    .../src/cdm-0.1.0$ make install

Note that the build also supports a "VPATH build", which allows building
out-of-tree, keeping the source code tree read-only and pristine. This is how
the author does it:

    ...
    .../src$ gzip -dc cdm-0.1.0.gz | tar xf -
    .../src$ chmod -R a-w cdm-0.1.0
    .../src$
    .../src$ mkdir cdm-0.1.0-BUILD
    .../src$ cd cdm-0.1.0-BUILD
    .../src/cdm-0.1.0-BUILD$ ../cdm-0.1.0/configure --prefix=/path/to/whatever
    .../src/cdm-0.1.0-BUILD$ make
    .../src/cdm-0.1.0-BUILD$ make check
    .../src/cdm-0.1.0-BUILD$ make install



Building from Git
=================

All developers working on the 'cdm' project need to be using the same versions
of the Autotools programs in the toolchain. Currently (as of 2025-03), those
versions are:

    automake 1.16.3
    autoconf 2.69

You can determine the versions in your PATH by invoking the respective tools
with the '--version' option:

    $ automake --version
    automake (GNU automake) 1.16.3

Check the cdm source out of Git from the project's public GitHub repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/salewski/cdm.git
    $ cd cdm

You'll notice that there is a 'configure' script in the root directory, as
well as 'Makefile.in' files scattered throughout the tree. These files are all
generated by the GNU Autotools, and are checked into Git to allow (in the
future) developers to configure the project upon cloning the Git repository.

Upon a fresh clone, you should be able to just run 'configure'. However, if
you find that your working directory somehow has timestamps out of sync, then
you can force a regeneration of all of the GNU Autotools-generated files.

Pre-configuration: The 'bootstrap' script

    $ pwd
    .../cdm
    $ ./bootstrap

The 'bootstrap' script is a thin wrapper around the 'autoreconf' program
(supplied by Autoconf), which itself invokes the GNU Autotools in the correct
order in such a way that it assumes all timestamps are invalid. This has the
effect of regenerating the autogenerated files with meaningful timestamps.

After you've run the 'bootstrap' script, you are ready to configure the
project for your host:

    $ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/wherever
    $ make
    $ make check

You probably do not want to run 'make install' from your Git working
directory. If you want to install ("for real") your newly hacked version of
the 'cdm' project, then create a distribution tarball and install using that:

    $ make distcheck
    $ ls | grep cdm
    cdm-0.1.1-snapshot.tar.gz

Note: It is not acceptable to simply invoke:

    $ make dist

for a release of the 'cdm' project. If the build does not pass the 'distcheck'
verifications, the package is considered broken.

For new releases, the version of the project must be changed in the
'configure.ac' file (to remove the '-snapshot' token, etc.), and the
'bootstrap' script re-run to regenerate the GNU Autotools generated files
(such as the 'configure' program and all 'Makefile.in' files).

After a release is made, the version number should be incremented with the
constant '-snapshot' appended to it. Again, the 'boostrap' script should be
re-run to regenerate the GNU Autotools generated files.

For example, during the development of the code that will be released as
version 0.1.1, the version number specified in 'configure.ac' should be:

    0.1.1-snapshot

This eliminates the possibility of producing artifacts labeled just '0.1.1'
which are not the final release.

When it comes time to do the release, the version number in 'configure.ac'
should be changed to remove the '-snapshot' suffix, and the 'bootstrap' script
rerun.

    0.1.1

The GNU Autotools generated files should be checked into Git, and the release
should be tagged. After the final release is tagged, the version number in
'configure.ac' should be bumped up for the next development cycle, and the
'bootstrap' script re-run.

    0.1.2-snapshot
